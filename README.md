# 👋 Hey, I'm Karthik!

## 🚀 Cloud-Centric Engineer | ASP.NET Developer | Microsoft Stack Enthusiast

I'm a Computer Science engineer with a burning passion for **Cloud Computing**—especially **Microsoft Azure**. I love building clean, scalable backend solutions using **C#**, **ASP.NET Core**, and **SQL Server**, and I'm constantly exploring how to deliver powerful apps with efficient cloud integration.

### 🔧 Tech Stack I Work With
- 💻 **Languages & Frameworks**: C#, ASP.NET Core, JavaScript, SQL, Bash, PowerShell
- ☁️ **Cloud & DevOps**: Microsoft Azure (my home turf!), Azure Functions, Azure App Services
- 🧰 **Tools & Environments**: Visual Studio, Git, Linux, Windows Terminal, VS Code
- 🛠️ **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server, T-SQL

I'm proficient with scripting using **PowerShell** and **Bash**, and I feel equally comfortable working in **Linux** and **Windows** environments.

### 💡 What I’m Working On
I'm currently building:
- A culturally-grounded wellness app using **.NET MAUI**
- Cloud-integrated tools using **Azure Functions**, tailored for real-world problems
- Projects that combine my interest in Formula 1 with data visualization and stats tracking

### 🧭 My Philosophy
I believe in building **real, working software** that helps people and solves actual problems. I care about **performance**, **clarity**, and **maintainability**—and I hate bloated, over-engineered code.

### 📬 Let's Connect
If you're into **Azure**, **cloud-native apps**, or just want to talk about **F1**, **WEC Hypercars**, or **Japanese litre bikes**, I’m always up for it.
